## Enhanced Persona-Driven Document Intelligence

### Methodology
1. **Content-Aware Processing**:
   - Uses Challenge 1A outlines as starting point
   - Extracts full text content for sections
   - Filters out non-descriptive headings (short/numeric)

2. **Hierarchical Relevance Ranking**:
   - Creates semantic context: "As [persona], [job]"
   - Uses Sentence-BERT for contextual embeddings
   - Ranks sections by heading + content similarity
   - Extracts subsections through paragraph-level analysis

3. **Cross-Document Analysis**:
   - Processes all documents in collection
   - Ranks sections across document boundaries
   - Selects top 5 most relevant sections

4. **Subsection Extraction**:
   - Splits content into meaningful paragraphs
   - Re-ranks paragraphs against persona context
   - Selects top 5 most relevant subsections

### Key Enhancements
- **Content Enrichment**: Overcomes limitations of outline-only data by extracting full text
- **Noise Filtering**: Automatically ignores non-descriptive headings (like "1.", "2.")
- **Contextual Understanding**: Embeds both persona role and specific task
- **Efficiency**: Uses lightweight model (80MB) within size constraints

### Compliance Features
- **Offline Operation**: Zero network dependencies
- **CPU Optimization**: Efficient embedding generation
- **Constraint Adherence**: 
  - Model size: 80MB < 1GB limit
  - Processing time: < 60s for 10 documents
  - Output format: Matches specification exactly
